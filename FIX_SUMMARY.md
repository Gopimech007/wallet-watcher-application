## 🔧 **What Was Fixed:**

### 1. **Restored & Fixed CSS**
- Completely rewrote the stylesheet to fix the "blank screen" issue.
- Restored all base styles, gradients, and layout rules.
- Fixed the corrupted `body` styles that were causing layout breakage.

### 2. **Mobile Layout Optimization**
- **Header**: Fixed at top (50px height), showing "Wallet Watcher".
- **Navigation**: Hamburger menu (☰) slides in sidebar from left.
- **Dashboard**:
  - **No Scrolling Needed**: All 6 stat cards now fit on one screen!
  - **Compact Layout**: Reduced padding, smaller icons, and tighter spacing.
  - **Hidden Month Selector**: Removed from dashboard view to save space (still available on other pages).
  - **2-Column Buttons**: Action buttons now arranged in a grid to save vertical space.

### 3. **Rebranding**
